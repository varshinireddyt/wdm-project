        <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
        <p>I am a graduate student. I am an freelance web devloper. I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challange and constantly set goals for myself so I have something to strive forward.
            I am not comfortable with settling, and I'm always looking for an oppurtunity to do better and achieve greatness. Also I like working in team, I believe that you'll learn faster and much more. As the saying goes <em>'two heads are better than one'</em>
        </p>
        <p>I am a people-person. I love meeting new people and learning about their lives and their backgrounds. I can almost always find common ground with strangers, and I like making people feel comfortable in my presence.
         I find this skill is especially helpful when working with new people.
